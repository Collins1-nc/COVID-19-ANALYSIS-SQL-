# COVID-19 ANALYSIS SQL

### Project Overview
This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 from 2020-2023, focusing on key metrics such as total cases, total deaths, death rates, and infection rates across different countries. The goal is to provide a data-driven understanding of the pandemicâ€™s effect across the globe. SQL and Power BI are used to design and transform a database for analysis and a dashboard that answers some key questions, respectively.

### Tools Used
PostgreSQL: Data cleaning, transformation, Pipelining, and preliminary analysis.

Power BI: Data modeling, visualization, and reporting.


### Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is an Excel workbook from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- 	Data importation from Excel to Postgres and Data Inspection.
- 	Created Views for visualization and reporting. 
- 	Data cleaning and formatting.
- 	Downloaded an image from a Web source and formated it.

### Data Visualization in Power BI
1.	What is the global death percentage?
2.	What are the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of death?
3.	Top 10 countries with the lowest COVID-19 death?
4.	What are the top 10 Countries with the highest infection rate?
5.	Show the global death percentage, the highest deaths, and the highest cases
6.	Top 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 death?

### Results
The results show that:
1.	The global death percentage is 0.904%, this shows the percentage of the global population that from COVID-19 from 2020-2023.
2.	Over 7 million people died from COVID-19 globally.
3.	About 770 million people had cases of COVID-19 globally.
4.	The United States (1.14m), Brazil (0.70m), and India (0.53m) amongst others have the most deaths.
5.	Nauru, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, etc., have minimal deaths (1-8 cases).
6.	Yemen with 18.1% leads to a high death rate ahead of others.
7.	Cyprus (73.76%), San Marino (73.31%), Brunei (69.51%), and others show high infection rates.
### Recommendation
From the analysis, we recommend the following;
1.	Countries with high death rates (Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia) have high death rates because of the wars going on in the countries and lack of proper medical infrastructure, therefore, there is an urgent need investment in healthcare infrastructure, improved access to medical supplies, and emergency response systems to reduce fatalities in future pandemics.
2.	Countries with high infection rates (Cyprus, San Marino, Brunei) should enhance early detection, testing, and contact tracing to control outbreaks faster and reduce the speed.
3.	Nations with deaths like (the United States, Brazil, and India) should promote booster vaccinations, mask mandates, and public awareness programs to prevent severe cases.
4.	Countries must share data, best practices, and research findings to create a unified global response against pandemics. WHO should standardize pandemic protocols to ensure equitable access to treatments and vaccines worldwide.
